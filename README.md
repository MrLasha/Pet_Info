## Chapter I

### Instructions

1. Throughout the course, you will experience uncertainty and a severe lack of information ‚Äî this is normal. Remember that the repository and Google are always available to you, as are your peers and Rocket.Chat. Communicate. Search. Rely on common sense. Do not be afraid of making mistakes.
1. Pay attention to sources of information. Verify, think, analyze, compare.
1. Read the assignments carefully. Reread them several times.
1. It's best to read the examples carefully as well. They may contain something not explicitly stated in the assignment itself.
1. You might encounter inconsistencies when something new in the task or example contradicts what you already know. If that happens, try to figure it out. If you fail, make a note under ‚Äúopen questions‚Äù and resolve it during your work. Do not leave open questions unresolved.
1. If a task seems unclear or unachievable, it only seems that way. Try decomposing it. Most likely, individual parts will become clearer.
1. Along the way, you'll encounter many different tasks. Those marked with an asterisk (\*) are for more meticulous learners. They are of higher complexity and are not mandatory, but if you do them, you'll gain additional experience and knowledge.
1. Do not try to fool the system or those around you. You'll only be fooling yourself.
1. Have a question? Ask the neighbor on your right. If that doesn't help, ask the neighbor on your left.
1. When using someone's help, always make sure you understand why, how, and what for. Otherwise, that help is meaningless.
1. Always push only to the **develop** branch! The **master** branch will be ignored. Work in the **src** directory.
1. Your directory should not contain any files other than those specified in the tasks.

- OOP/procedural/multiparadigm approach in Java;
- Differences from C and C++;
- Functional paradigm;
- Asynchronous/parallel programming.

## Chapter III

### Project: Pet Info

We will explore OOP/procedural/multiparadigm approaches in Java, writing code according to the functional paradigm, as well as asynchronous/parallel programming through a project that is a set of modules for displaying information about pets.

**Attention!** Each task should be organized as a separate project. For example,
`T02/src/exercise0`, `T02/src/exercise1`, ‚Ä¶ , `T02/src/exerciseN-1`, where **N** is the number of tasks. If a previous task is needed for the next one, simply copy the previous project into the directory for the next task and continue development there.


#### Task 1. Pet List

Develop a module that compiles a list of pets and outputs information about each pet.

- Create an abstract class Animal with two private fields: a String for the pet's name and an int for the pet's age.
- Implement a constructor for the abstract class Animal that takes two parameters (pet name as a String, pet age as an int) and assigns these values to the corresponding fields.
- Implement getters for the private fields (pet name as a String, pet age as an int).
- Create a class Dog that inherits from the abstract class Animal.
- Implement a constructor in Dog that takes two parameters (pet name as a String, pet age as an int) and passes them to the base class constructor.
- Override the toString() method in Dog so that it produces the following string:

  "Dog name = [pet\_name], age = [pet\_age]"

- Create a class Cat that inherits from the abstract class Animal.
- Implement a constructor in Cat that takes two parameters (pet name as a String, pet age as an int) and passes them to the base class constructor.
- Override the toString() method in Cat so that it produces the following string:

  "Cat name = [pet\_name], age = [pet\_age]"

- The program reads the number of pets.
- The program reads the type of the pet: dog/cat.
- Each pet is added to a general pets list.
- If an incorrect pet type is entered, the program outputs:

  "Incorrect input. Unsupported pet type"

  and proceeds to the next input.

- If a negative or zero age is entered, the program outputs:

  "Incorrect input. Age <= 0"

  and proceeds to the next input.

- The program should not terminate with an error on invalid input. Instead, it outputs:

  "Could not parse a number. Please, try again"

  and retries the input.

- The program must output information about each pet.
- The program works with reference data types.

|**Input**|**Output**|
| :- | :- |
| 3 <br/> dog <br/> Snowball <br/> 12 <br/> dog <br/> Snowball2 <br/> 10 <br/> dog <br/> Snowball3 <br/> 9 <br/>  | Dog name = Snowball, age = 12 <br/> Dog name = Snowball2, age = 10 <br/> Dog name = Snowball3, age = 9 <br/>  |

- Implement getters for the private fields (pet name, pet age, pet weight).
- Declare a method getFeedInfoKg() in the abstract class Animal that returns a double representing the amount of food needed.
- Create a class Dog that inherits from the abstract class Animal.
- Implement a constructor in Dog that takes three parameters (pet name, pet age, pet weight) and passes them to the base class constructor.
- Implement the getFeedInfoKg() method in Dog, which calculates the required amount of food using the following formula:

  food amount = pet weight \* 0.3

- Override the toString() method in Dog to produce the following string:

  "Dog name = [pet\_name], age = [pet\_age], mass = [pet\_weight], feed = [food\_portion]"

- Create a class Cat that inherits from the abstract class Animal.
- Implement a constructor in Cat that takes three parameters (pet name, pet age, pet weight) and passes them to the base class constructor.
- Implement the getFeedInfoKg() method in Cat, which calculates the required amount of food using the following formula:

  food amount = pet weight \* 0.1

- Override the toString() method in Cat to produce the following string:

  "Cat name = [pet\_name], age = [pet\_age], mass = [pet\_weight], feed = [food\_portion]"

- The program reads the number of pets.
- The program reads the pet type to be input: dog/cat.
- Each pet is added to a common pets list.
- If an incorrect pet type is entered, the program outputs:

  "Incorrect input. Unsupported pet type"

  and proceeds to the next input.

- If a negative or zero age is entered, the program outputs:

  "Incorrect input. Age <= 0"

  and proceeds to the next input.

- If a negative or zero weight is entered, the program outputs:

  "Incorrect input. Mass <= 0"

  and proceeds to the next input.

  "Could not parse a number. Please, try again"

  and retry the input.
